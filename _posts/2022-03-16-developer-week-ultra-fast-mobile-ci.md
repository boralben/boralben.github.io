I was given the opportunity to speak on speeding up CI workflows for mobile apps at Developer Week SF in February. My talk, "Seven Steps to Ultra-fast Mobile Continuous Integration," discussed the following areas:

1. `git` parameters
1. `xcodebuild` options
1. `gradle` settings
1. cloud resources
1. Android emulator configs
1. dependency caching
1. build runner resources

Have a watch!
